% gen
% this file generates the set of detectors discovered from a labeled dataset (i.e. 15 scene dataset)

% i'm not sure how the ranking of the final detectors gets stored,
% so this is just a best guess situation. I'm taking the detectors
% from findetectors[] or batch/round(last).
% I'm using the first 100 from each set of detectors.
